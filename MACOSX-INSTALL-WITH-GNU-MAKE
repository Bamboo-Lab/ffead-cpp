BSD based Installation

1. Download the tar file and extract it to the location of your choice.
2. Make sure Xcode is installed or at-least the Command line tools are present
3. Install homebrew first using,
   		ruby -e "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.github.com/mxcl/homebrew/go/install)"
4. Install Openssl using brew "brew install openssl"
5. Install UnixODBC using brew "brew install unixodbc"
6. Also included prototype.js in source for AJAX support
7. Go to the ffead-server/Release or ffead-server/Debug depending on whether you need to debug the server code
8. Open terminal and type "make all" and "make build-apps" to build the server and the default applications provided ("make all" will build ffead with all modules enabled)
9. From version 1.8 onwards you can also select modules to build within ffead using the make modules={comma separated module list} all command, for a complete list of modules names please refer Modules, for e.g, to only build modules webservice,binserialize and distocache use the command "make modules=webservice,binserialize,distocache all"
10. This will create the distribution folder named ffead-server inside ffead-server/Release or ffead-server/Debug folders accordingly
11. Type ./server.sh when inside the ffead-server folder to start the application server
12. Some sample default applications are already provided for your reference inside the ffead-server/web folder, the default application is served at urlpath /, the flexApp application at /flexApp and the oauthApp at /oauthApp
13. If you did not already perform "make build-apps", then to compile a given web application shared library go to the ffead-server/web/{default/flexApp/oauthApp/(your_custom_app)}/src/Debug folder and run "make all"
14. Place the generated application shared library inside the ffead-server/Release/ffead-server/lib or ffead-server/Debug/ffead-server/lib folder.
15. Place your custom web applications inside the ffead-server/Release/ffead-server/web folder (Note the application folder name will also be the URL path - application name)
16. Remember all installation files(makefile,subdir.mk) assume the ports are installed to the /usr/local/lib directory, in case you choose custom settings during 
    installation of dependencies then make sure to change all files to include the -L/usr/local/lib to -L/location/of your/choice
