Installation Directions

1. If using autotools based installtaion for ffead-cpp then please refer to the AUTOTOOLS-ANY-OS-INSTALL (Apache Module Section) for directions on install, ignore the run.sh/run_cygwin.sh steps mentioned here if you are using the ffead-cpp autotools build and skip points 8-11
2. This method describes the installation of the module as a standalone module and not as a part of the ffead-cpp build, using run.sh/run_cygwin.sh accordingly
3. Install Unix-ODBC and required odbc files for MySQL dependency alongwith development files
4. Install Open-SSL and development files
5. Install apache/httpd and apache-devel/htttpd-devel files
6. Go to the ffead-cpp binary folder installed using the autotools method or the earlier method (using Debug/Release folders)
7. Copy the binary ffead-cpp folder to the apache web folder eg, /var/www/html or any other location of your choice

-- Don't follow these steps if using the direct autotools build method as defined in point 1 --
8. Got to the apache_mod_ffeadcpp folder
9. Change the FFEAD_CPP_PATH variable in run.sh to point to the path according to point 7
10. cd apache_mod_ffeadcpp and run.sh/run_cygwin.sh
11. This will install the mod_ffeadcpp module to apache http modules and update http config as well, execution of the script may require sudo access for copying the module to /usr/lib
-- End --

12. Add the following lines to httpd.conf, the FFEAD_CPP_PATH value should be as per point 7,
    LoadModule ffead_cpp_module /usr/lib/apache2/modules/mod_ffeadcpplib.so
    FFEAD_CPP_PATH "/var/www/ffead-cpp-2.0-bin"
13. Add the LD_LIBRARY_PATH variable to your apache envvars file, 
	export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=$FFEAD_CPP_PATH/lib:/usr/local/lib:$LD_LIBRARY_PATH
14. Add a virtual host section to your enabled sites in apache2 configuration,
	<VirtualHost *:8080>
		DocumentRoot /var/www/ffead-cpp-2.0-bin
		SetHandler ffead_cpp_module
	</VirtualHost>
14. Restart apache server, check the url http://localhost/index.html on your browser
